## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I feel good about my Javascript code. I think it's short, clear and works great!

### Continued development

I think I really need to work on images position. It was a very tricky work and I don't think I've done a fine job placing the images.
